# PassAuditor
Framework that will help you determine if your password is existing in attack dictionaries, with added features for evaluating your current password based on searching attack dictionaries for any possibilty of it exising in them; plus, it will try to determine the length of time someone will requiere to brute force your current password based on various algorthms. It also will contain a feature for password generation based on multiple default and user selected options to then try to determine length of time for brute force. Plus, I will try to add feature for easy Hashcat or John The Ripper manipulation. Also, it will make use of open-source tools for hash cracking.

# Usage
Just clone, and run python3 passaudit.py for starting. Easy, right?

Note .- What you see in the image is what's working so far
